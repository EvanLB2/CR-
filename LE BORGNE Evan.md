**I.**  I chose VIM because I think when we hear something about an open source text editor or even when we use   
one, it is more about OpenOffice or Libre Office when we used to work on windows. I didn't know VIM  
and I think it is interesting to learn something new (even if it not seems to be the best text editor and it  
looks terrible compare to the others that exist).  
        
**II.** If we look at the repository of this project created by Bram Moolenaa, we can see those following informations :  
 
|        | Number |
|--------|--------|  
| Commits | 15.5k |  
| Forks | 4k |  
| Watchers | 685 |  
| Stars | 26.4k |  

In the README.md, we can find different informations about Vim but also the paths in the repositository if we want  
more precision about how to install it for example.  
Around the folders, we can find some datas about the different documents in the repository :
- Vim is a cross-platform text editor   
- there are 99 contributors to this project
- most files are writen in Vim Script (the scripting language built into Vim) or in C
- you can sponsor the project by clicking [here](https://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php)  

The repository does not seem to have an external documentation, the only external thing from the main author that  
is quoted on the repository is about the official website of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).  

**III.** In the Pull Requests part, we can see the different changes that people have pushed to a branch. For example,  
we can find the update of the Serbian traduction that have been committed on 20 january and checked 5 times.
